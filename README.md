# AramChat
This is a very basic chatroom with multiple users.

The structure of the program is based on TCP/IP. It has a very basic GUI made by Tkinter library.

For testing this chatroom, you can use ngrok:

First download ngrok.
  1.Move ngrok in your project directory.
  
  2.Run ngrok and write: “ngrok tcp (port that is used by server)”.
  
  3.Ngrok shows you a host and a port that you can use them for client to connect to the server.
  
  4.Server host is: “localhost” and server port is: a number between 1024 and 65535.
